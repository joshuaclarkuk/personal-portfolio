        <h1>About</h1>

        <!-- Body -->
        <p class="body-text">Family circumstances meant that I couldn’t take the traditional university route, 
        but I’ve always been committed to learning and personal growth. 
        In my earlier roles in retail and administration, I developed essential skills in communication, 
        adaptability, and problem-solving. 
        My hard work was recognized with promotions to management positions, 
        where I successfully led teams and improved processes. 
        This same drive and dedication has been mirrored in my current role, where I now manage a data team, 
        further honing my leadership, collaborative, and analytical abilities.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
        Alongside my professional responsibilities and family commitments, I’ve pursued a keen interest in software development. Through self-directed learning, I’ve gained experience in programming with C++, C#, and GDScript, primarily focusing on game development. I’ve tackled complex problem-solving, collaborated using source control systems like Git, and become comfortable navigating Linux and the command line to streamline workflows. These experiences have taught me how to manage my time effectively, clean coding principles, and programming patterns.
